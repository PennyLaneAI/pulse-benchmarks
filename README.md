Some basic benchmarks for `pennylane.pulse` for public display.

We run the basic benchmark of evolving a state according to

$$ H(t) = \sum_q \omega_q Z_q + \sum_q g_q Y_q \otimes Y_{q+1} +  \sum_q f_q(t) X_q \otimes X_{q+1} $$

and then computing the expectation value of 

$$ H_\text{obj} = \sum_q c^X_q X_q \otimes X_{q+1} + c^Y_q Y_q \otimes Y_{q+1}. $$

As time-dependent envelopes $f_q(t)$, we use a (modulated) Gaussian in resonance with the qubit frequencies $\omega_q = 5$GHz.

The main benchmark is done in [Forward-pass_PL_QUTIP_QISKIT_M1.ipynb](Forward-pass_PL_QUTIP_QISKIT_M1.ipynb). We ran this on an Macbook Pro 16 with an M1 pro chip. We get qualitatively identical results using an Intel i7-1260P in an LG gram 16 (2022), see [Forward-pass_PL_QUTIP_QISKIT_i7-1260P.ipynb](Forward-pass_PL_QUTIP_QISKIT_i7-1260P.ipynb).
